Task 3 Was a read-and-write assignment to a Database. required designing a relevant Schema and executing SQL commands for validation and sanitation of a new user.

Task 4 Builds on Task 3 and uses stored information in Database to provide login access to webpages according to status of user. For example an admin user will be able to see all pages, whereas a student can only see one and an academic can see some.
Handle the state of webpage with Cookies as well as navigation. Implemented with an MVC framework.
